Migration Guide
---------------

CRAM File Support
    This release adds support for CRAM files. They are linked in studies and IGV
    sessions similar to BAM files. If your project contains CRAM files uploaded
    prior to this release, you will have to run :guilabel:`Update Sheet Cache`
    in the Sample Sheets app to enable the files in study links and generated
    IGV sessions. Alternatively, an administrator can run the ``synccache``
    management command to update all projects or a specific project.


v0.14.1 (2023-12-12)
====================

Release for minor updates, maintenance and bug fixes.

- Add iRODS v4.3 support
- Add sheet sync setting validation
- Change default IGV genome to "b37_1kg"
- Fix landing zone locking controls for non-superusers
- Fix access to new HP ontology URLs
- Fix sheet column toggle modal UI issues
- Minor updates and bug fixes
- Upgrade to SODAR Core v0.13.3

Migration Guide
---------------

Default IGV Genome
    The default IGV genome for cancer and germline projects has been changed
    from "b37" to "b37_1kg", as the former is no longer supported by new
    versions of IGV. Existing settings referring the now-unavailble genome will
    be automatically updated. Users should be advised to upgrade their IGV
    software to a recent version.
HPO Term Accession
    The official API for the Human Phenotype Ontology has changed. It is
    recommended to set the default URL pattern in the Ontology Access app to
    ``https://hpo.jax.org/app/browse/term/{id_space}:{local_id}``. Furthermore,
    ``hpo.jax.org`` should be included in ``SHEETS_ONTOLOGY_URL_SKIP`` as
    bioontology.org-wrapped URLs to the new API do not work at the time of
    writing.
