Admin User Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The general SODAR user interface displayed for an admin mostly looks the same as
for the regular user. Differences are detailed in this and following
subsections.


Project Access
==============

Project access it not restricted for administrators. You will be able to access
all projects in the SODAR database and access all project related features.
Similarly, features such as the project list and SODAR search cover all
categories and projects in the system.

.. note::

    iRODS access is not automatically granted to SODAR administrators. For
    accessing the iRODS system you need to follow the practices of your
    organization.


.. _admin_ui_site_apps:

Site-Wide Admin Apps

Additional applications for administration are available in your
