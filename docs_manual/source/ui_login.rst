Login Screen
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The login screen is very much self-explanatory.

When connected to multiple authentication sources, use your usual user name
followed by `@DOMAIN` of your home organization and your password in your home
organization.

For example, at BIH, use `@CHARITE` or `@MDC-BERLIN`.

At other sites, your administrator should have setup an appropriate messages
such as the one for BIH that you see above.

If enabled, you can also see a separate button for single sign-on as configured
by your organization.
