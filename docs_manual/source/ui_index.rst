User Interface Overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section describes the SODAR user interface (UI).

Great care has been taken to make the usage of SODAR as intuitive and
self-explaining as possible and to make features *discoverable*. That is, if we
(the SODAR authors) were successful then you should be able to find most SODAR
features by following visual cues. You should also be able to understand the
majority of the system without reading long manual text.

However, scientific data management comes with intrinsic complexity and SODAR
does not attempt to hide this from you. This manual tries to list the major
features, thus help with discoverability, and also explain these features in a
sufficient manner.

.. note::

    Supported web browsers for the SODAR UI are the latest versions of
    `Mozilla Firefox <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/>`_ and
    `Google Chrome <https://www.google.com/chrome/>`_. Other modern browsers may
    work with the site, but are not supported by the authors. Javascript must be
    enabled for full UI functionality.

.. warning::

    The SODAR UI will **not** function correctly on Microsoft Internet Explorer
    or other legacy browsers!

The following screenshot displays the *home view*, which appears after logging
in from the :ref:`login view <ui_login>`.
