User Interface Overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section describes the SODAR user interface (UI).

Great care has been taken to make the usage of SODAR as intuitive and
self-explaining as possible and to make features *discoverable*. That is, if we
(the SODAR authors) were successful then you should be able to find most SODAR
features by following visual cues. You should also be able to understand the
majority of the system without reading long manual text.

However, scientific data management comes with intrinsic complexity and SODAR
does not attempt to hide this from you. This manual tries to list the major
features, thus help with discoverability, and also explain these features in a
sufficient manner.

The following figure shows the home view that appears after logging in from
the :ref:`login view <ui_login>`.

    SODAR home view

The main element in this view is the list of projects available to you. In
SODAR, data and user access are structured into *projects*, which exist under
*categories*. A category can be thought of as a project with no data and the
possibility to contain other categories or projects under it.

You can see the following UI components:

SODAR Site Title
    Click this to return to the home view.
Search
    Search in SODAR projects and data. Start the search by pressing :kbd:`Enter`
    or clicking :guilabel:`Search`. You need to enter at least three characters.
    Left to the search box is a button to access advanced search, in which you
    can enter multiple search terms at once.
Manual
    Access this manual.
Help
    Terse inline help that describes the components currently visible in the UI.
    This may not be enabled for all views.
User Icon
    Click this to open the :ref:`user dropdown <ui_user_dropdown>`.
Home
    Click this to return to this home view.
Available Projects
    Browse all SODAR projects that you have access to.
    There are couple of useful shortcuts, e.g.,

    - adding a new landing zone accessing existing ones,
    - directly browse files through Davrods, or
    - view or import sample sheets.
Starred Button
    Filter projects to those that you have favourited by clicking on the star
    icon in the project views.
Filter
    Filter projects and categories to those containing a search string.
