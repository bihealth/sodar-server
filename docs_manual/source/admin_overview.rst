Administration Overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section provides information for SODAR administrators on features for
maintaining a SODAR instance.

The following extra features are available for SODAR administrators:

- Full access to all projects (Note: iRODS access must be separately granted)
- Ability to create categories on the root level
- Additional site-wide administrative applications
- Access to Django admin UI
- SODAR management commands (Note: shell access to SODAR server required)
- SODAR site settings (Note: server deployment access required)

.. note::

    SODAR is built on the `SODAR Core <https://github.com/bihealth/sodar-core>`_
    platform. Knowledge of the platform and going through the
    `SODAR Core documentation <https://sodar-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
    is highly recommended for SODAR administrators. This section will refer to
    the SODAR Core docs where applicable. Knowledge of the
    `Django <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/>`_ web framework is also very
    useful.

.. note::

    Deployment of SODAR is outside of this documentation's scope. To get started
    with deployment, see the
    `SODAR Docker Compose <https://github.com/bihealth/sodar-docker-compose>`_
    repository and associated documentation.
