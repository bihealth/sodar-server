Administration Overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This section provides information for SODAR administrators on features for
maintaining a SODAR instance. Topics covered include deployment and
configuration of SODAR as well as features only available to administrator level
users.

.. note::

    SODAR is built on the `SODAR Core <https://github.com/bihealth/sodar-core>`_
    platform. Knowledge of the platform and going through the
    `SODAR Core documentation <https://sodar-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
    is highly recommended for SODAR administrators. This section will refer to
    the SODAR Core docs where applicable. Knowledge of the
    `Django <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/>`_ web framework is also very
    useful.
