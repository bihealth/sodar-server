.. warning::

    When using Microsoft Windows, please note that the built-in Zip archiver
    will fail to properly handle ISA-Tab files due to naming conventions. We
    recommend `NanaZip <https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/nanazip/9N8G7TSCL18R>`_
    for working with ISA-Tab Zip archives under Windows.
