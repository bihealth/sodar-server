Project Overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you navigate into a project, you can see the project overview on the right
hand side of the screen. The sidebar on the left hand side has been expanded to
display links related to the project.

Below the site title bar there is a navigation breadcrumb. It can be used to
easily return to a parent category. The project title bar displays the project
title, description and project-specific links.

    Project overview

If you are viewing a category instead of a project, you will see a more limited
set of information and sidebar links, while still following the same general
structure.


Overview Section
================

The project overview section on the right hand side of the view consists of the
following elements:

ReadMe
    An optional description for the project in MarkDown notation. Can be updated
    :ref:`project update view <ui_project_update>` by users with an *owner* or
    *delegate* role.
Sample Sheets Overview
    Lists the investigation, studies and assays in the project's
    :ref:`sample sheets <app_samplesheets>`. Along with file statistics you can
    see buttons that allow you to copy the corresponding iRODS path to the
    clipboard, copy the WebDAV URL to the clipboard, or directly link into the
    WebDAV URL for browsing the files.
Landing Zones Overview
    Displays the five most recently created
    :ref:`landing zones <app_landingzones>`.
Timeline Overview
    Displays the five most recent events taken in the project. Your project role
    define the events that you can see.
