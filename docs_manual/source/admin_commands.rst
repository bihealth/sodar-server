This section briefly lists the management commands available for SODAR

and used third party components. For more details on their usage, use the
``-h`` or ``--help`` argument.

``cleanappsettings``
    Clean up unused application settings.
``deletecache``

``synccache``
    Synchronize the SODAR Cache.
``syncgroups``
    Synchronize user groups.
``syncmodifyapi``
    Synchronize project metadata and user access in iRODS. Generally should only
    be used in development.
``syncremote``

    is enabled.


SODAR Commands
==============

These commands originate from the SODAR applications and are specific to
operations regarding sample sheets, landing zones, iRODS data and ontologies.

``busyzones``
    Return list of currently busy landing zones.
``importobo``
    Import OBO format ontology. See :ref:`admin_ontologyaccess`.
``importomimm``
    Import OMIM catalog as an ontology. See :ref:`admin_ontologyaccess`.
``inactivezones``
    Return list of landing zones last modified over two weeks ago.
``irodsorphans``
    Find orphans in iRODS project collections.
``normalizesheets``
    Clean up and normalize previously imported sample sheets for
    non-standard data or other issues. Also updates render tables and creates a
    backup ISA-Tab version of the normalized sheets.
``syncnames``
    Synchronize alternative names for sample sheet material search.
``syncstudytables``
    Build study render tables in cache for all study tables. These will be
    automatically built when accessing sample sheets if existing  cache is not
    up-to-date, but this can be used to e.g. regenerate the cache if something
    has been changed in study table rendering.
