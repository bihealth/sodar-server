SODAR Development Documentation
===============================

SODAR (System for Omics Data Access and Retrieval) is a specialized system for
managing data in omics research projects.

This documentation contains instructions and guidelines for installing,
deploying and developing the system.

.. note::

    This project is under heavy development and all features are not yet fully
    documented. Improved documentation is forthcoming.

This documentation is under construction and rather minimal. For the basics of
SODAR project management and/or information on developing SODAR Core and its
apps, see `SODAR Core documentation <https://sodar-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

Make sure to checkout the ``dev`` branch of all repositories for development.
