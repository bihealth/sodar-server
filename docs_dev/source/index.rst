   Under construction!

This documentation is under construction and rather minimal. For the basics of
SODAR project management and/or information on developing SODAR Core and its
apps, see the more up-to-date docs in the
`SODAR Core <https://cubi-gitlab.bihealth.org/CUBI_Engineering/CUBI_Data_Mgmt/sodar_core>`_
project.

Make sure to checkout the ``dev`` branch of all repositories for development.
